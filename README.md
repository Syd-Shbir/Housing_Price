# Housing Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to build a Machine Learning model for predicting housing prices based on patterns extracted from the **USA_Housing dataset**. This dataset contains features related to housing sales in the USA, such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, year built, and other relevant attributes. The target variable is the **SalePrice**, which represents the price of a house. This project is structured into two phases:

1. **Phase I**: Data cleaning, exploration, and preprocessing.
2. **Phase II**: Machine learning model building, validation, and prediction.

By analyzing correlations among features and applying robust machine learning models, we aim to accurately predict house prices and provide valuable insights into the factors influencing them.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of various features describing the physical and qualitative attributes of houses. The key attributes include:

- **SalePrice**: The target variable representing the price of the house.
- **YearBuilt**: The original construction year of the house.
- **GrLivArea**: Above-ground living area in square feet.
- **OverallQual**: Overall material and finish quality.
- **Neighborhood**: Physical location within city limits.
- **LotArea**: Lot size in square feet.
- **GarageCars**: Garage size in car capacity.
- **TotalBsmtSF**: Total basement area in square feet.
- **FullBath**: Number of full bathrooms above grade.
- **Bedroom**: Number of bedrooms above basement level.
- **KitchenQual**: Kitchen quality rating.

### Dataset Source
The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), and additional features include a wide range of structural, design, and condition-related attributes.

## Project Phases

### Phase I: Data Cleaning and Exploration
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, outliers, and irrelevant features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the relationships between the features and the target variable.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating meaningful features to improve the predictive power of the model.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Analyzing the correlation between features like square footage, number of rooms, and SalePrice.

### Phase II: Model Building and Prediction
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost)
- **Model Validation**: Using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared to evaluate model performance.
- **Feature Importance**: Identifying which features contribute most to housing price predictions.
